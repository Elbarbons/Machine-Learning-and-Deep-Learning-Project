# Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Project

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of our visual place recognition model for geolocalization, building on the work by Ali-Bey et al. The project focuses on two primary enhancements:

- Adjusted Miner Behavior: Reclassifying certain negative images as positive based on proximity to improve model robustness.
- Model Comparison: Evaluating various combinations of miners and loss functions to determine the best configuration.

## Repository Contents
- Code: In the *Source* folder can be found implementation of the visual place recognition model with both traditional and new methodologies.
- Results: In the *Results* folder can be found two Python Notebooks containing training and results of every model.
- Datasets: The datasets used for this project can be downloaded at this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ucy9JONT26EjDAjIJFhuL9qeLxgSZKmf).

## Credits
Credits to the [original implementation](https://github.com/amaralibey/gsv-cities) on which our work is based.
